# "Age of Total War" studying website

A [studying website](https://dylngg.github.io/age_of_total_war_prep/index.html) for my "Age of Total War" (HIST 3210) class at the University of Utah. The website presents a generated id that has been discussed in class and prompts the user to input the "Who, what, when, where and why the id matters". After three generations of ids, the user can then answer the last studying questionâ€“"What is the relationship between the items?". For each of these prompts, there is a hidden answer, with exception to the relationships question due to logistical challenges of writing relationships between hundreds of ids.
